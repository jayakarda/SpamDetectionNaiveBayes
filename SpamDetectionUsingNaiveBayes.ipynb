    "Spam detection is one of the major applications of Machine Learning. \n",
    "I will be using the Naive Bayes algorithm to create a model that can classify dataset SMS messages as spam or not spam, based on the training we give to the model. \n",
    "Usually spam emails have words like 'free', 'win', 'winner', 'cash', 'prize' and the like in them as these texts are designed to catch your eye and in some sense tempt you to open them. Also, spam messages tend to have words written in all capitals and also tend to use a lot of exclamation marks. To the recipient, it is usually pretty straightforward to identify a spam text and our objective here is to train a model to do that for us!\n",

    "## Bag of words\n",
    "What we have here in our data set is a large collection of text data (5,572 rows of data). Most ML algorithms rely on numerical data to be fed into them as input, and email/sms messages are usually text heavy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bag of Words(BoW) concept is a term used to specify the problems that have a 'bag of words' or a collection of text data that needs to be worked with. The basic idea of BoW is to take a piece of text and count the frequency of the words in that text. It is important to note that the BoW concept treats each word individually and the order in which the words occur does not matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the below process, we can covert a collection of documents to a matrix, with each document being a row and each word(token) being the column, and the corresponding (row,column) values being the frequency of occurrance of each word or token in that document.\n",
    "\n",
    "To handle this,I will be using sklearns count vectorizer method which does the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "It tokenizes the string(separates the string into individual words) and gives an integer ID to each token.\n",
    "It counts the occurrance of each of those tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CountVectorizer method automatically converts all tokenized words to their lower case form so that it treats words like 'The' and 'the' the same. It has the parameter called lowercase which is by default set to True.\n",
    "\n",
    "It also ignores all punctuation so that words followed by a punctuation mark (for example: 'hello!') are not treated differently than the same words not prefixed or suffixed by a punctuation mark.\n",
    "It has the parameter token_pattern which has a default regular expression that selects tokens of 2 or more alphanumeric characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third parameter is the stop_words parameter. Stop words refer to the most commonly used words in a language. They include words like 'am', 'an', 'and', 'the' etc. By setting this parameter value to english, CountVectorizer will automatically ignore all words from our input text that are found in the built in list of english stop words in scikit-learn. This can be really helpful since stop words can skew the calculations when we are trying to find certain key words that are indicative of spam.\n"
